        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Are you looking for a way to elevate your ham and cheese sandwich experience? Are you hosting a party and need a dish that will be a hit? Do you love King's Hawaiian rolls?</p>
        <p>If you said yes to any of these questions, I've got just the recipe for you! This one is a fan favorite and a staple at any game day party that <em>I'm</em> attending. All you really need is ham, cheese, rolls, and butter, but that extra drizzle on top really does add that little bit of <em>oomph</em> that everyone loves in a good slider.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>This recipe doesn't call for specific quantities of each ingredient, so those decisions are left to the chef (and hey, that's you!)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>King's Hawaiian rolls</li>
            <li>Ham (honey, smoked, deli, pre-packaged - it all works the same!)</li>
            <li>Your favorite cheese, but swiss is a classic pairing</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise (or Miracle Whip, if that's more your cup of tea)</li>    
            <li>Melted butter</li>
            <li>Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Onion powder</li>
            <li>Poppy seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°.</li>
            <li>Slice the rolls in half horizontally. Do your best to keep the rolls connected to each other, but hey, accidents happen!</li>
            <li>Set the top section aside and add the bottom section to a baking dish (any size dish, as long as the rolls fit inside!)</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of mayo on the insides of both sections.</li>
            <li>Layer the ham and cheese evenly across the bottom section of rolls, then place the top section of rolls back on top.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the butter, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and poppy seeds in a small bowl. Feel free to taste as you go, customizing the sauce to your liking!</li>
            <li>Brush the butter mixture evenly over the top of the fully constructed sliders.</li>
            <li>Let the sliders sit for 5-10 minutes to fully soak in the flavor that makes them so darn delicious.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake until the cheese is melted and the top is golden-brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional</strong>: eat the whole pan in one sitting!</li>
        </ol>
