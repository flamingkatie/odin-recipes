My first official project!

This is a basic HTML website that showcases three of my favorite recipes. This website was completed following the lessons and guidelines from The Odin Project's "Foundations" course. The project tested (and affirmed) my knowledge of writing out the HTML boilerplate, utilizing basic HTML features, and using both Git and GitHub.

The website consists of a Homepage (index.html) and three separate pages for each recipe. These pages were built using HTML elements such as headings, relative links for images, paragraphs, bold and italic text, both unordered and ordered lists, list items, and relative links for navigating between recipes and the homepage.

I had a lot of fun creating this website, and it made me even more confident in the HTML skills I've learned thusfar! It's very satifying creating something from scratch :)

All three recipes are written in my own words with a bit of *whimsy* added, but the meat (heh, pun) of the recipes comes from the following websites:
